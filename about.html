            <h3>Who is Alejandro?</h3>
            <p>I am a Málaga-born and raised self-taught Front End Engineer, currently living near Düsseldorf, 
               Germany. Besides learning German, 
               my interest lie in the NFT world, my wonderful family, and - of course - coding websites. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>After exploring different careers in Spain and England, I finally made the decision to do what 
               I am truly passionate about:
               Creating outstanding websites that feature both: Modern functionalities and a contemporary design.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I started my career with FreeCodeCamp where I obtained my first certificate in Responsive Web Design.
               With this basic knowledge I was eager to deepen my skills with Codecademy. 
               Here I successfully graduated with additional certificates in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and lastly a Front End Engineer qualification.
            </p>
